            <h2>My guitar and bass</h2>
            <p> I have been playing guitar for about 13 years now so I was about 7 years old when I started. I began by learning how to play the acoustic guitar, but as I aged I wanted to
                start playing the electric guitar. So I played the acoustic guitar for about 6 years before I got my first electric guitar. I have been playing the electric guitar for around 7 years.
                Bass was an instrument I kind of picked up along the way as it is very similar to the guitar and easy to learn from having played guitar for so long. I have been playing the bass for about 4 years now mostly just for fun. 
                I enjoy playing both instruments from time to time, but I have to say that I prefer the electric guitar over the bass. Just because I feel like there is more you can do with the electric guitar than the bass. 
                I played in my high schools/middle schools band while I was there, but other than that I haven't been played in any bands. Below is a list of my guitars and bass.
                 I have had a few guitars in the past which I can't remember the models of, but I have sold them to get new ones.
