                <!-- Some general information about my motorcycles and why I started motorcycling-->
                <h2>My motorcycles</h2>
                <p> I have 2 motorcycles. An Aprilia RS4 125, which was my first motorcycle, and my latest motorcycle, the Ducati Monster 
                    S2R 800. I have been riding motorcycles for about 5 years now. I have a lot of fun riding them and I also enjoy working on them. 
                    They are my way of relaxing and getting away from the stress of everyday life. I have been to a few motorcycle events, like theKonnuslahti, 79150 
                    moottoripyörä messut and I am planning to go to more in the future.
                    I plan on getting a larger motorcycle this year, but Im not sure what to get yet. I dont really know why I started motorcycling, but it has quickly become one of my favorite hobbies. 
                    I have done quite a few roadtrips with my motorcycles, the longest one being about 1000km all together. I plan on doing a roadtrip this summer maybe to the west coast of Finland. 
                    Below I have a table with the details of my motorcycles. I also have a video of the Ducati Monster S2R 800, which is my latest motorcycle.
